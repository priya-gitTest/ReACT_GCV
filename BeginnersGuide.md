# A Beginners Guide to Working with Web Data in Python

## The Goal
Web data provides great insights in online visual culture. This guide describes the first steps in working with web data in Python. Web data is understood here as information drawn from the Internet in the form of web pages (usually .html files) and their associated metadata such as the language of the webpage and its date of publication. The guide discusses the process of data cleaning and harmonization, and subsequently focusses on frequency analysis as a way to study visual culture through sources drawn from the web.

## Programming for Distant Viewing and Reading
Working with web data requires a lot of curation. Many steps are involved in structuring the data in such a way that allows for summarizing and counting. Programming languages are helpful in doing both the data curation and the data analysis in a way that is reproducible and effective. This guide explains how to do this in Python, one of the most popular and versatile programming languages of today.

It is important to note that Python is a _object-oriented_ programming language. Contrary to for example functional or procedural languages it is centered around objects and methods applied to those objects. The exact difference between languages goes beyond the scope of this guide, but be aware that no programming language is perfect and different languages serve different purposes.

The _commands_ that are written in Python are usually stored in scripts that have a ```.py``` file extension. These scripts are executed in the terminal. The terminal is accessible in Windows by looking for _cmd_ in the list of applications (bottom-left corner) and in MacOs by opening the _terminal_ application from the application menu. Once the terminals are opened, it is necessary to navigate to the folder where the ```.py``` script is stored. Usually, the terminal opens in the ```/home``` folder on MacOs or on the ```C:``` drive folder on Windows. Navigating "down" can be done by typing ``cd subfoldername``.
