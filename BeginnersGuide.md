# A Beginners Guide to Working with Web Data in Python

## The Goal
Web data potentially offers great insights into cultural trends. This Beginners Guide describes the first steps in working with web data in Python. First, it is important to realize what is meant by web data. In the case of the Notebooks found in this repository, web data is understood as information drawn from the Internet in the form of web pages (usually .html files) and associated metadata such as the language of the webpage and its date of publication. A great deal can be done with this type of data. This document does not dive into the endless possibilities of statistical inference but focusses on the ways frequency tells us about cultural trends.

First, programming languages are discussed as tools to work with data. This also includes a description of the basics of Python, one of the most popular and versatile programming language.
